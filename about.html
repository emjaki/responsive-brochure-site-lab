        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>John Nixon (1949&ndash;2020) was a prolific printmaker. From 1982 onwards, Nixon made 524 prints of which 335 were unique works and 189 were editions (varying between 2 and 15 impressions). Sometimes these prints were executed at the artist's home and studio using the back of a spoon to make relief prints and other times they were made in printmaking workshops with the assistance of their resident printmakers.</p>
        <p>There is a great depth of material exploration throughout Nixon's print archive that aligns with the concerns of his painting practice. With his embrace of quotidian materials across his chosen artforms, Nixon often reached for commercial papers or even paper bags for his substrate.</p>
        <p>This approach also informed his consideration of the matrix, which varied from traditional materials like copper and steel, to cork, potatoes, and food packaging. In each instance, the artist's interest was not only in the material itself, but what it had to offer by way of its transfer to paper.</p>
        <p>Many of the works that will be exhibited from John Nixon's Editions Archive will be presented for the first time in a series of exhibitions, the first of which took place in 2021 at Negative Press. While there was never any doubt with John that painting was his main 'line', as he would call it, his extensive engagement with printmaking offers a rich and deep vein of his practice that is still to be fully disseminated.</p>
